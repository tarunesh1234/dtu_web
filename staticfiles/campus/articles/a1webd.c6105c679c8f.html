    <p>Are you trying to learn web development, but not sure where to start?<br>

You’ve probably already tried looking on Google for how to learn, and there are a lot of resources out there. But many of them include way too much information.<br>

Right now, all you need is the basics of web development — a general explanation with some direction on where to go next.<br>

And that’s exactly why I’ve written this straightforward guide on how to become a web developer…

</p>
<h1><strong>If you’re a beginner coder, this guide is for you!</strong></h1>
<p>Here is what this guide covers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An explanation of the basic areas in web development.</li>
  <li>An overview of programming languages and frameworks,</li>
  <li>And recommended resources to help you learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s geared for beginners, with helpful links and information to give you a head start into your own research.
Here’s what we’ll be going through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I've covered here is just what I use most often and should get you comfortable</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>What’s your ultimate goal in learning to code?</strong></h2>
<p>In his book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen R. Covey asserts that in order to be successful, you have to “begin with the end in mind.”

Consider your own reasons for getting into coding… What end are you aiming for?

What is your ultimate goal?

Are you looking for a fun hobby, a career change, a flexible job where you can be closer to your family?<br><br>

<strong>Your entire approach to web development should be centered around achieving this one dream.</strong><br><br>

You can even try writing down your goal, and putting it someplace where you will see it everyday, like your bathroom mirror or next to your computer.

As you go through this article, keep your goal in mind, and let that determine what decisions you make: which languages to learn, even how you choose to learn.

With that said, let’s get started with the basics!

<h2><strong>Part 1: The basics</strong></h2>
<p>This might seem obvious, but I’m going to say it anyway:<br><br>

<strong>At its core, web development is all about building websites.</strong><br><br>

<ol>
  <p>Here is a simple explanation of how websites on the internet work:</p>
  <li><strong>Websites</strong> are basically a bunch of files stored on computers called servers.</li><br>
  
  <li><strong>Servers are computers</strong> that are used to host websites, meaning that they store the website files. These servers are connected to the giant network called the World Wide Web (to use 90’s lingo), or the Internet.</li>
  <br>

  <li><strong>Browsers are programs</strong> that you run on your computer. They load the website files via your internet connection. Your computer is also known as the client, which connects to the server.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>The 3 components that make up every website</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, websites are made up of files, mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Let’s take a closer look at each of them:<br>

<strong>HTML or HyperText Markup Language</strong><br>
HTML is the foundation of all websites. It’s the main file type that is loaded in your browser when you look at a website.

You can actually make a very very basic website just using HTML and no other types of files.

It won’t look very interesting, but that’s the minimum that you need for a website to be a website.

(If you’re interested in the basics of HTML, you can check out a video/blog tutorial I have about that.)<br><br>
<br><br>
<strong>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets</strong><br><br>
Without CSS, a website will look as aesthetically pleasing as a Word document.

With CSS, you can add colors of all kinds, compelling fonts, and layout the website in pretty much any way you please.

You can even add animations and draw shapes using more advanced CSS.
<br><br>
<strong>JavaScript</strong><br><br>
JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to interact with elements on the website and to manipulate them.

While CSS adds style to HTML, JavaScript adds interactivity and makes a website more dynamic.

For example, you can use JavaScript to scroll to the top of the page when you click a button, or to build a slideshow with buttons to navigate through the images.

To work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, you’ll need to use a program on your computer called a code editor.

Which brings us to the next point:


</p>

<h2><strong>Which code editor should you use?</strong></h2>
<p>
  This is a very common question, especially if you’re just starting out.
<br>
The best code editor for you will be highly dependent on what kind of code you’re writing.
<br>
If you’re doing mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you could code in Windows Notepad or TextEdit for Macs if you wanted to.
<br>
But what would the fun be in that?
<br>
Code editor programs like Sublime or VS Code come with a lot of features that just make coding easier.
<br>
They allow you to indent multiple lines of text right or left, and can highlight the text in different ways depending on what language the file is in.
